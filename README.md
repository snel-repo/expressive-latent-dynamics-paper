## Codebase Structure
- `paper_src` - Source code that defines core dataset generation, model architecture, training, and evaluation functionality
- `configs` - [`hydra`](https://hydra.cc/)-composable config files that define data, model, and training hyperparameters
- `datasets` - Synthetic HDF5 datasets generated using `paper_src.data.ChaoticDataModule`
- `runs` - Checkpoints, training logs, and hyperparameters for models used in paper figures (Note: some files, including Tensorboard logs, have been removed to conserve space)
- `scripts/analysis` - Scripts that generate paper figures using trained models
- `scipts/training` - Scripts that retrain single models or multiple models in parallel using [`ray.tune`](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html)

## Installation
After cloning the repo, create a `conda` environment and use `pip` to install the `paper_src` package and its dependencies.
```
conda create -n expressive-paper python=3.9
conda activate expressive-paper
cd expressive-latent-dynamics-paper
pip install -e .
```

## Reproducing Figures Using Trained Models
To reproduce figures from the paper, move to the `scripts/analysis` directory and run the following scripts:
- `1_plot_dataset.py` - Figure 1a
- `2_plot_metrics.py` - Figures 1c, 2a, and 2c
- `3_plot_trajs_fps.py` - Figures 1d, 2b, 2d, and 3a
- `4_plot_eigvals.py` - Figures 3b-e

## Training Models from Scratch
To train a single new model, move to the `scripts/analysis` directory and run the `train_single.py` script. This script will compose a configuration from the base config at `configs/single.yaml`. To overwrite the defaults defined in this config, you may edit the config itself or specify overrides directly to the train function. Model checkpoints and training logs will be stored at `runs/user_runs/single`.

To train many models in parallel, use the `train_multi.py` script. The script is set up to train all model-dataset combinations used in the paper (N=210), on multiple GPUs, with several models per GPU. Please refer to the [docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) for more information about the `ray.tune` API.

Note that `run_multi.py` script will put all of the runs in the same folder, which will need to be loaded slightly differently to be compatible with the analysis pipeline. However, loading from a single folder should be similar to, but easier than, loading from several subfolders.
